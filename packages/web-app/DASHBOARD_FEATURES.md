## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd /Users/beauxwalton/code-check
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**:

   ```bash
   cd packages/web-app
   ./start-dashboard.sh
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Access Dashboard**:
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Navigate between Project List, Run Details, and Rules pages
   - Test real-time features (requires WebSocket server)

4. **Build for Production**:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

While the core dashboard is complete, potential future enhancements could include:
