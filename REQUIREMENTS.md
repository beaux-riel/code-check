   - Summary statistics
   - Code quality metrics
   - Identified issues and recommendations

3. **Web-based Interface**
   - Local server startup
   - Browser-based dashboard
   - Results visualization

4. **VS Code Integration**
   - Extension installation
   - Command palette integration
   - Results display within VS Code

### Analysis Capabilities (MVP)

- **File Statistics:** Count, size, types
- **Code Quality:** ESLint integration, complexity metrics
- **Dependencies:** Package.json analysis, unused dependencies
