# Rule Library Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive rule library implementation for Code Check, providing rule sets for design patterns, security (OWASP), performance (React/Vue best practices), code quality, and reusability with default severity levels and user configuration overrides via `codecheck.config.ts`.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Rule Library Structure

Created a modular rule library organized into 5 main categories:

#### Security Rules (`/packages/core-engine/src/rules/security.ts`)

- **12 OWASP-based security rules** including:
  - SQL Injection prevention
  - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) prevention
  - CSRF protection
  - Hardcoded secrets detection
  - Insecure deserialization
  - Weak cryptography
  - Path traversal prevention
  - Dangerous eval() usage
  - ReDoS (Regular Expression DoS)
  - And more...

#### Performance Rules (`/packages/core-engine/src/rules/performance.ts`)

- **18 performance optimization rules** including:
  - **React-specific** (7 rules): Anonymous functions, memoization, useCallback, inline props, keys, lazy loading
  - **Vue-specific** (5 rules): v-for keys, computed vs methods, v-show vs v-if, functional components, async components
  - **General** (6 rules): Memory leaks, bundle optimization, blocking operations, DOM optimization

#### Design Patterns Rules (`/packages/core-engine/src/rules/design-patterns.ts`)

- **18 design pattern implementation rules** including:
  - Creational patterns: Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype
  - Structural patterns: Decorator, Facade, Adapter, Proxy, Composite
  - Behavioral patterns: Observer, Strategy, Command, Chain of Responsibility, State, Template Method
  - Architectural patterns: MVC, Repository, Dependency Injection

#### Code Quality Rules (`/packages/core-engine/src/rules/code-quality.ts`)

- **26 code quality and maintainability rules** including:
  - Complexity metrics: Cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity, nesting depth
  - Function design: Length limits, parameter count, return consistency
  - Code organization: Duplicate code, dead code, magic numbers
  - Naming conventions: Variables, functions, classes
  - Style consistency: Line length, whitespace, quotes, semicolons, imports
  - Error handling and best practices

#### Reusability Rules (`/packages/core-engine/src/rules/reusability.ts`)

- **22 reusability and DRY principle rules** including:
  - DRY principle enforcement
  - Function and component reusability
  - Configuration and parameterization
  - Generic types and interfaces
  - Framework-specific patterns (React hooks, Vue composables)
  - Architectural patterns for reuse
  - Module organization

### 2. Rule Library Management (`/packages/core-engine/src/rules/rule-library.ts`)

Implemented `RuleLibrary` class with comprehensive functionality:

- **Rule Set Management**: Automatic registration of 9 predefined rule sets
- **Configuration Override**: Support for user customizations
- **Framework Detection**: Automatic rule filtering by framework (React/Vue/Angular/Node)
- **Rule Resolution**: Smart rule resolution with inheritance and overrides
- **Category Filtering**: Rules organized by category, tag, severity, and framework
- **Export/Import**: Configuration serialization and deserialization

#### Predefined Rule Sets:

- `security-recommended`: Essential security rules
- `react-performance`: React-specific performance rules
- `vue-performance`: Vue-specific performance rules
- `performance-recommended`: General performance rules
- `design-patterns`: Design pattern guidelines
- `code-quality-essential`: Core quality rules
- `reusability-patterns`: Reusability and DRY rules
- `recommended`: Balanced set for most projects (extends security + code quality)
- `strict`: High standards for enterprise projects (extends security + code quality + design patterns)

### 3. Configuration System (`/packages/core-engine/src/config/CodeCheckConfig.ts`)

Created comprehensive configuration system:

#### `CodeCheckConfig` Interface

- Rule and rule set configuration
- File inclusion/exclusion patterns
- Framework detection settings
- Severity thresholds and fail conditions
- Output format configuration
- Performance and cache settings

#### `CodeCheckConfigManager` Class

- Configuration merging and validation
- Rule-specific configuration management
- Export/import functionality
- Integration with rule library

#### Default Configuration

- **Security rules**: High priority (mostly `error` severity)
- **Performance rules**: Medium priority (`warning` for critical, `info` for optimizations)
- **Quality rules**: Context-dependent (`warning` for complexity, `info` for style)
- **Design patterns**: Low priority (mostly `info`, some `warning`)
- **Reusability**: Medium priority (`warning` for DRY violations, `info` for suggestions)

### 4. User Configuration File (`/codecheck.config.ts`)

Created comprehensive sample configuration file with:

- **Detailed documentation** for each configuration option
- **Example configurations** for different project types:
  - Strict enterprise projects
  - React performance-focused projects
  - Security-critical applications
- **Sensible defaults** with explanation
- **Framework-specific settings**
- **Customizable severity levels** and thresholds

### 5. Integration and Compatibility

#### Updated RuleRegistry (`/packages/core-engine/src/registry/RuleRegistry.ts`)

- **Backward compatibility** with existing rule system
- **Integration layer** between old and new rule systems
- **Automatic loading** from the new rule library
- **Configuration bridging** for seamless migration

#### Main Export Updates (`/packages/core-engine/src/index.ts`)

- Added exports for all new rule library components
- Maintained backward compatibility
- Exposed configuration management

### 6. Type System (`/packages/core-engine/src/rules/types.ts`)

Comprehensive type definitions:

- `RuleMetadata`: Enhanced rule definition with framework support, examples, references
- `RuleSetMetadata`: Rule set definition with inheritance
- `ConfigurationOverride`: User configuration interface
- `SeverityLevel`: Extended severity levels including 'off'
- `RuleCategory`: Typed rule categories

### 7. Documentation (`/packages/core-engine/src/rules/README.md`)

Comprehensive documentation including:

- **Rule category explanations** with examples
- **Configuration guides** with code samples
- **Usage patterns** for different scenarios
- **Best practices** for rule management
- **Integration guidelines** for developers
- **Performance considerations**

## Severity Levels and Defaults

### Default Severity Matrix

| Category        | Critical Issues            | Important Issues | Style/Info |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| Security        | `error`                    | `warning`        | `info`     |
| Performance     | `warning`                  | `warning`        | `info`     |
| Code Quality    | `warning`                  | `warning`        | `info`     |
| Design Patterns | `warning` (architectural)  | `info`           | `info`     |
| Reusability     | `warning` (DRY violations) | `info`           | `info`     |

### Severity Configuration

Users can override any rule severity in `codecheck.config.ts`:

```typescript
rules: {
  'cyclomatic-complexity': {
    severity: 'error',
    configuration: { maxComplexity: 8 }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { ruleLibrary } from '@code-check/core-engine';

// Get recommended rules
const rules = ruleLibrary.getResolvedRules(['recommended']);

// Get React-specific rules
const reactRules = ruleLibrary.getRulesByFramework('react');

// Get security rules only
const securityRules = ruleLibrary.getRulesByCategory('security');
```

### Configuration

```typescript
import { CodeCheckConfigManager } from '@code-check/core-engine';

const configManager = new CodeCheckConfigManager({
  extends: ['strict'],
  framework: 'react',
  rules: {
    'react-avoid-anonymous-functions': { severity: 'error' },
  },
});
```
